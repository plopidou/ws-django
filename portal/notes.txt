several noteworthy files per "view" here:


. consumers.py
  contain simple function that return:
  - a context, taken from contexts.py
  - a template name
  all used by the generic websocket consumer, to render the context using the template
  and sending the string to the client

. urls.py and views.py are standard
  any view would fetch its context from contexts.py
